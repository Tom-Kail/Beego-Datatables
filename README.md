##Reason of creating this repository
  When I using Google and Baidu to search "beego datatables ajax", I can't find the information which could really help to figure out my problem.
  Maybe, up to now, there is still only a very samll group of programmers using Golang to build there website. So the info I have searched can't found in the internet. 
  So, I have to guess how Datatables's original API ajax() works. It cost lots of time to get right answer. Now I want to share what I learned and hope it could do some help.
