##Reason of creating this repository
　　Useing Google and Baidu I can't find helpful information about "beego datatables ajax".<br/>
　　Maybe, up to now, there is still to few Golang programmers.<br/> 
　　So, I have to guess how Datatables's API ajax() works which cost lots of time.<br/> 
　　I want share what I have learned.
